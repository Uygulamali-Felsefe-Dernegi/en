traditional patterns of thought and seek new answers to radical questions.\n\nThe event, which also featured talks by members of our association, encouraged critical approaches and offered an in-depth examination of how the practical and theoretical limits of philosophy can be transcended. \"Transcending Boundaries\" provided participants with a strong ground for intellectual courage and intellectual deepening.\n\n"}}]},"title":{"teasers":[{"link":{"url":"/","label":"Lorem"},"image":{"alt":"","src":"https://picsum.photos/600/400?blur=10","url":"https://picsum.photos/600/400?blur=10","size":null},"title":"Commodo

It was one of Van Gogh's favorite paintings, but it was painted at a distinctly troubled time in a life full of troubles. Van Gogh had recently been committed to a mental hospital in <em>Saint-Rémy-de-Provence</em>, trying to recover from the delirium that followed the famous incident in which he cut off his own ear. While undergoing treatment, he painted <em>The Mulberry Tree</em> along with other famous works such as <em>The Starry Night</em> and <em>Suspens</em>. He died by his own hand less than a year later, three weeks after writing a letter to his brother Theo reassuring him that <em>\"I still love art and life very much\"</em>. He shot himself in a field where he was painting, but the wound was not immediately fatal and he was able to walk back to his room at the <em>Auberge Ravoux</em>. Van Gogh died the following evening.

The contrast between the bright, rocky hillside, the dark autumn colors of the tree and the dark blue sky gives the painting a special vitality and energy.

The world we share is fraught with serious challenges; and there are countless potential existential crises patiently waiting their moment on the stage. We have just gone through a global pandemic unlike anything we have seen in a century; and the effects of COVID-19 are still destabilizing the world economy and reverberating through the lives of individuals. I remember back in early January 2020, when I told colleagues at my university who were still in denial about what was happening that \"every single one of us will know someone who will die from this.\" Sadly, that turned out to be quite true. But in a way, we were lucky with COVID-19. Other <em>zoonotic</em> pathogens (those that can be transmitted from animals to humans) would have been incalculably worse. The infection mortality rate for COVID-19 seems to hover around 1-2%, but the mortality rate for MERS is 35%, for H5N1 flu 50-60%, and for Nipah 40-75%. Each of these viruses has been transmitted from animals to humans but has not yet - and I mean not yet - become contagious enough to cause a pandemic, which would be a disaster to rival the Plague of Justinian. War also remains a threat, as the invasion of Ukraine proves. The suffering people who horrified me in the gallery that afternoon were, just a few weeks before, living lives just like mine: pursuing personal and professional goals, visiting their museums, sipping coffee and wine, playing with their children, living, laughing, loving. Despite more people living free from violence than at any other time in human history, resurgent authoritarianism, bellicose rhetoric and alarming nuclear saber-rattling remind us that democracy, freedom, peace and stability are fragile achievements that are never won once and for all. Not all conflicts are planned or even the result of rational calculations; they can start unintentionally or accidentally and can easily spiral out of control, escalate and spread. And of course, against the background of these disturbing possibilities, a truly unprecedented existential threat is simmering, to which we are currently paying insufficient attention. <em>Antropogenic</em> (human-induced) climate change is cooking us slowly, but it's cooking us nonetheless, like the frog in the proverbial, albeit fictional, frog that doesn't jump out of the slow-heated pot.</p>\n<hr />","markdown":"I think my students, at least some of them, are asking themselves similar questions.

The infection mortality rate for COVID-19 seems to hover around 1-2%, but the mortality rate for MERS is 35%, for H5N1 flu 50-60%, and for Nipah 40-75%. Each of these viruses has been transmitted from animals to humans but has not yet - and I mean not yet - become contagious enough to cause a pandemic, which would be a disaster to rival the Plague of Justinian. War also remains a threat, as the invasion of Ukraine proves. The suffering people who horrified me in the gallery that afternoon were, just a few weeks earlier, living lives just like mine: pursuing personal and professional goals, visiting their museums, sipping coffee and wine, playing with their children, living, laughing, loving. Despite more people living free from violence than at any other time in human history, resurgent authoritarianism, bellicose rhetoric and alarming nuclear saber-rattling remind us that democracy, freedom, peace and stability are fragile achievements that are never won once and for all. Not all conflicts are planned or even the result of rational calculations; they can start unintentionally or accidentally and can easily spiral out of control, escalate and spread. And of course, against the background of these disturbing possibilities, a truly unprecedented existential threat is simmering, to which we are currently paying insufficient attention. *Antropogenic* (human-induced) climate change is cooking us slowly, but it is cooking us nonetheless, like the frog in the proverbial, albeit fictitious, proverb about not jumping out of the slow-heated pot.\n***\n"}}]},"title":{"teasers":[{"link":{"url":"/","label":"Lorem"},"image":{"alt":"","src":"https://picsum.photos/600/400?blur=10","url":"https://picsum.photos/600/400?blur=10","size":null},"title":"Commodo proident esse","description":{"html":"<h1 id=\"thisissomemarkdown\">This bit of markdown</h1>","markdown":"# It's a bit markdown"}},{"link":{"url":"/","label":"consectetur"},"image":{"alt":"","src":"https://picsum.photos/600/400?blur=10","url":"https://picsum.photos/600/400?blur=10","size":null},"title":"Ad culpa labore","description":{"html":"<h1 id=\"thisissomemarkdown\">This bit of markdown</h1>","markdown":"# It's a bit markdown"}}]},"favicon":{"teasers":[{"link":{"url":"/","label":"veniam"},"image":{"alt":"","src":"https://picsum.photos/600/400?blur=10","url":"https://picsum.photos/600/400?blur=10","size":null},"title":"Aute nostrud est","description":{"html":"<h1 id=\"thisissomemarkdown\">This bit of markdown</h1>","markdown":"# It's a bit markdown"}},{"link":{"url":"/","label":"ut"},"image":{"alt":"","src":"https://picsum.photos/600/400?blur=10","url":"https://picsum.photos/600/400?blur=10","size":null},"title":"Ea ad dolor","description":{"html":"<h1 id=\"thisissomemarkdown\">This bit of markdown</h1>","markdown":"# It's a bit markdown"}}]},"description":{"teasers":[{"link":{"url":"/","label":"laborum"},"image":{"alt":"","src":"https://picsum.photos/600/400?blur=10","url":"https://picsum.photos/600/400?blur=10","size":null},"title":"No Animation","description":{"html":"<h1 id=\"thisissomemarkdown\">This bit of markdown</h1>","markdown":"# It's a bit markdown"}},{"link":{"url":"/","label":"culpa"},"image":{"alt":"","src":"https://picsum.photos/600/400?blur=10","url":"https://picsum.photos/600/400?blur=10","size":null},"title":"Duis sint labore","description":{"html":"<h1 id=\"thisissomemarkdown\">This bit of markdown</h1>","markdown":"# It's a bit markdown"}}]}},"page":"66c3fec4-6b59-4879-b3fd-94301d212853","symbol":"3e5ecd43-7bce-467c-b9b3-39a3640b82a5","index":3},{"id":"90a76a55-0e57-43d3-8264-21ed17b0cd60","content":{"en":{"teasers":[{"link":{"url":"","label":"","active":false},"type":"text_under_image","image":{"alt":"","url":"https://vkicwhqjbrcbwhfzomjp.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/b274fd34-60fe-4f3f-bdfb-58926ab8f35f/1726500953959collageeww1%20(1).jpg"},"title":"III.","description":{"html":"<p>I repeat, who has time for <em>Beowulf</em> in a world like this?</p>\n<p>In October 1939, C.S.

Ama sabah kalktığımda dünyayı iyileştirme (veya kurtarma) arzusu ile dünyanın tadını çıkarma (veya tadını çeşitlendirmek) arzusu arasında kalmış bir şekilde uyanıyorum. Bu da günü planlamayı zorlaştırıyor.”* Bu çok yerinde görünüyor. Ve günü planlamak zorsa, bir hayatı planlamak daha da zordur.\n\nHem dünyayı kurtarmaya hem de dünyanın tadını çıkarmaya çağrılıyoruz; ve iddia ediyorum ki, tanıklık ettiğimiz dünyanın tadını çıkararak ve başkalarına neden kurtarılmaya değer olduğunu hatırlatmaya yardımcı olarak ve belki de bunu yaparken sonuçta onu kurtarmaya küçük de olsa bir katkıda bulunuyoruz.\n\n## \\*\\*\\*\n\n***Dipnot***: <small>Bu yazı, Brian Treanor'ın [\"Humanities on a Burning Planet\"](<https://philosophersmag.com/humanities-on-a-burning-planet/>) başlıklı yazısından çevrilmiştir.
